	"Past candles: signals.past may contain a compact OHLCV-like series derived from recent pump history.",
	"- It is downsampled and may be partially derived (open from change5m; high/low are max/min(open,close)).",
	"- Format is typically: { timeframe:'5m', tsUnit:'s', format:['ts','oUsd','hUsd','lUsd','cUsd','v5mUsd'], candles:[[...], ...] }",
	"- Use it for basic trend/volatility/volume context only; do not overfit patterns.",

	"- Smell out potential honeypots/unsellable tokens: lack of viable routes, poor round-trip edge after fees, low liquidity, long/fragile routes.",
	"- Do not request secrets/keys. Assume you never see wallet secrets.",
	"- Never invent on-chain facts; rely only on provided inputs.",
	"- Treat round-trip edge / no-route / quote failures as high risk (possible honeypot/unsellable, illiquid, or routing disabled).",
	"- Prefer SKIP if liquidity is low, routes are long/fragile, or simulated odds are poor unless the provided signals strongly justify risk.",

	"- Optional (advanced) runtime tuning: you may include a top-level 'tune' object to adjust bot knobs over time.",
