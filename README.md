## 🧩 Widgets

- Auto Pump (src/views/widgets/auto.js)
  - Auto wallet mode with local keypair, quick copy/export
  - Router/dust protections: min-notional buy/sell, cooldowns, pending credit reconciliation
  - Leader mode: rotate to top pumper; optional multi-buys with batching
  - Position cache + graceful pending-credit sync to avoid race conditions
  - Sell logic: TP/SL, trailing stop, partials, staleness, max/min hold, dust-exit toggle
  - Fallback flow: split-sells, higher slippage re-quotes, USDC bridge sell, manual v0 send
  - Reserve management: fee/rent/runway buffers, ATA rent estimation per swap
  - Integrated wallet menu: SOL total, sellable vs dust by Jupiter’s min-notional

- Swap Modal (src/views/widgets/swap.js)
  - Phantom connect, programmatic sign, session verification (PoW) via Turnstile proxy
  - Quote preview: est output, min-received, route hops, slippage bps stepper
  - Fee routing via fee ATAs (ExactIn), sanity checks on-chain
  - Mobile deep-link to jup.ag; desktop Dex link fallback
  - Accessible modal, keyboard-safe on mobile, and throttles the live stream while open

  - Fan-fav leaderboard with cached fetch + token metadata enrichment
  - Responsive card-style layout on mobile
  - Quick links to token pages and live stats

## 📈 Custom KPIs (hand-written)

- Pumping Radar (PUMP) (src/views/meme/addons/pumping.js)
  - Short lookback with fast decay for immediacy
  - Hard gates: min liquidity, 1h volume, price sanity
  - Acceleration signals: 5m→1h, 1h→6h, z-scored 1h volume surprise
  - Breakout vs recent lows, liquidity scaling, buy pressure boost
  - Badge system: 🔥 Pumping · Warming · Calm

- DEGEN Bottom Sniper (DEGEN) (src/views/meme/addons/degen.js)

## ⚙️ Data Engine

- Streaming pipeline (src/engine/pipeline.js)
  - Ingests multiple feeds with windowed keyword scanning
  - TokenStore for stable, NaN-safe merges; MarqueeStore for “Trending/New”
  - Scoring + recommendations with guarded “measured-only” emission
  - Adaptive stream pause/resume hooks for UI (swap modal, etc.)
  - Ad loader + deterministic selection

- Fee/rent/runway reserves; ATA rent estimated per route
- Pending credit watcher + cache-first reconciliation
- Router cooldown on dust/no-route errors (per-mint)
- Sell fallbacks: split sizing, slippage bumps, USDC bridge, manual v0 send
- Dust-exit toggle with user-defined min SOL out

---

## 🔧 Config Highlights

- swap.js CFG
  - jupiterBase, rpcUrl, auth/turnstile, platformFeeBps
  - fee ATAs per mint, tokenDecimals hints
  - Builders to construct Dex/Jupiter URLs for mobile/desktop
